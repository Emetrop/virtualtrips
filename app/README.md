### Getting started

Go to `backend` directory first and run `npm i && npm run start`.

After open in another terminal `frontend` directory and run `npm i && npm run start`.

#### Backend

Backend is a typical 3 layer architecture following principle of separation of concerns.

Controller - api directory
Service - services directory
Data access layer - models directory

.env file which should not normally be pushed to git is present here for painless run.
